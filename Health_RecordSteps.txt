Health Records :
Step 1 : Define a form class for HealthRecord ( take reference from models.py)
    record_date = date on which health record was taken
    height_cm = height in cm
    weight_kg = weight in kg
    blood_pressure_systolic = blood pressure int
    blood_pressure_diastolic = blood pressure int
    any_chronic_disease = string to store disease's name


Step 2 : Add a link to HealthRecord.html.j2 on dashboard.py

Step 3 : Modify HealthRecord.html.j2 to get inputs from the user ( take reference from  worker_details.html.j2)

Step 4 : define API in app.py
        1. use app.route to redirect to health-records URL.
        2. check if the user is signed in by using @login_required.
        3. Create an instance of your healthRecords form class ( import it first at the top).
        4. Check if the form is validated when submitted ( take reference from worker_details)
        5. Create a HealthRecord model class instance. take input using form.field_name.data
        6. add the user to db instance using db.add.user()
        7. commit the transaction on Databse using db.commit() and flash the success message.
        8. Redirect to dashboard
        9. If the form was not validated redirect to the same page ( healthRecords) to enter correct details.
